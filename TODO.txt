+ The main technical feature that RTWho needs is a Windows server that can enumerate users
logged into a Windows domain. This would make RTWho a lot more interesting to the VTC community.

+ Various UI improvements should be made. The information displayed about users should be
enriched.

+ Some thought needs to be given to privacy issues. What about users who don't want to be
monitored in this way?

+ Unit tests and documentation are always good. RTWho lacks both.
