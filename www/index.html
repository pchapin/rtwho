    <h1>RTWho Project Page</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p>RTWho is a program that monitors users on several systems at once in real time. It
    consists of a client and one or more servers. Each server runs on a machine that is to be
    monitored and collects information about the users currently logged into that machine. The
    client can be configured to poll one or more servers to retrieve the collected user
    information. The client then provides an integrated display of this information, letting the
    client's user monitor several machines simultaneously.</p>

    <p>Currently the only client available is a Windows program and the only server available is
    for POSIX systems (Linux, FreeBSD). There are plans to create additional clients and
    servers. For example, a server could be created that monitors an IRC channel and thus allows
    the client to display information about who is on that channel.</p>

    <h2>Downloads</h2>

    <p>An experimental <a href="RTWho-0.0.zip">Win32 client archive</a> is available. To
    install, unpack the archive in an empty folder, edit the <tt>RTWconfig.cfg</tt> file (see
    below), and then run <tt>RTWho.exe</tt>. RTWho does not use the registry nor does it modify
    the state of your system. To uninstall, simply delete the folder you created above. RTWho
    can be run from flash drives.</p>

    <p>Note that RTWho is currently under development and is very much unfinished. It lacks
    important features and may have significant bugs. Only run the current release of RTWho if
    you are willing to run experimental, pre-alpha software. At the moment RTWho is not
    versioned; each build is instead marked with a build date (shown in the title bar of the
    main window). Use this date to distinguish different releases during the development phase
    of the program.</p>

    <p>If you wish to install an RTWho server, you currently need to compile it from source. No
    server distribution is available at this time.</p>

    <h2><tt>RTWconfig.cfg</tt> Documentation</h2>

    <p><tt>RTWconfig.cfg</tt> is the RTWho client configuration file. It is a plain text file
    intended for editing by humans. RTWho looks for its configuration file in the same folder as
    the <tt>RTWho.exe</tt> executable.</p>

    <p>Lines in <tt>RTWconfig.cfg</tt> are of the form <tt>NAME=value</tt>. Blank lines are
    ignored and all material on a line after a '#' is ignored. Lines can be of arbitrary length.
    It is recommended that you do not include spaces around the '=' in each <tt>NAME=value</tt>
    pair. Each NAME is called a configuration parameter.</p>

    <p>The following configuration parameters are defined</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>SERVERS</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A space delimited list of servers the client should poll for user information. Each
        server definition is in the form <i>hostname:port</i>. The port specification is
        required (since RTWho has no default port). The entire list must be provided on a single
        line.</p>
          
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
          <tt>SERVERS=solstice.vtc.edu:9001 lemuria.cis.vtc.edu:9001</tt>
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Compiling RTWho</h2>

    <p>The source code for RTWho is available via Subversion at the URL
    <tt>svn://whirlwind.cis.vtc.edu/RTWho</tt>.</p>

    <p>RTWho makes use of a separate library of network related classes named <i>netstream</i>.
    This library is included in the source tree; it does not need to be separately downloaded.
    However, you should keep in mind that netstream is logically independent of RTWho and
    provides build control files that can optionally be used to just build that library. During
    the compilation of the RTWho the netstream library is compiled automatically so you don't
    need to worry about netstream unless you want to.</p>

    <h3>Windows Client and Server</h3>

    <p>At the top of the source tree you will find a file <tt>RTWho.sln</tt> which is a solution
    file for Visual Studio 2008. This solution contains separate projects for the Windows client
    and the Windows server. Building the solution will build both projects.</p>

    <p>The client requires that the Xerces XML library be installed and compiled first. To do
    this, download Xerces-C from the Apache XML web site and unpack it in a suitable location.
    RTWho was built using Xerces-C v3.0.0 although other nearby versions of Xerces will probably
    work. Set the environment variable XERCESCROOT to point at the folder where you installed
    Xerces. The Visual Studio project files use this environment variable to locate the Xerces
    library.</p>

    <p>In addition there is an Open Watcom project file named <tt>RTWho.wpj</tt> in the root of
    the source tree. This project only contains a target for the Windows server because, at this
    time, Open Watcom is not able to compile the Windows client (the Xerces library does not
    support Open Watcom, for one thing).</p>

    <h3>POSIX Server</h3>

    <p>The POSIX server assumes the compiler is <tt>gcc</tt>. Go into the <tt>servers/POSIX</tt>
    directory and type <tt>make</tt> to build the program. The resulting executable,
    <tt>rtwhod</tt>, can be run as a demon process. It expects a port number on the command
    line. There is no default port.</p>
